# Surfs Up Analysis 

# Overview of the analysis:
This analysis purpose is to understand the trends in temperature for the Island of Oahu, Hawaii, United States. The data analysis is to be used to help W.Avy determine if it is a good decision to open up an ice cream and surf shop business on the island. This specific analysis is on the temperature trends in June and December to understand if an ice cream and surf shop is a sustainable year round business.

# Results:
The analysis covered 1500-1700 temperature records in June and December where there was no significant difference between the average temperature in these two months.
The difference in max temperature was 2 degrees between June (85F) and December (83F) and 8 degress in min temperature (June: 64F, Dec: 56F)

# Summary:
It can be concluded that we can make the recommendation to W.Avy to open up an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu as the data suggests it will be a year round sustainable business due the minimum variance in temperature across the Summmer and Winter. 

## Recommendations 
We could enrich the analysis by looking at more data points for temperature.
We could also look to include additional data points such as wind and tidal frequencies to determine if there is a significant difference in surfing conditions.
